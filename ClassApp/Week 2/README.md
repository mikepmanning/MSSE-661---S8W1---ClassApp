# Module 2 - Basic Fluid Layout

Build a basic website using HTML tags to create a "Hello World' website with a basic layout.

We'll be using CSS fluid layout to improve the look of our "Hello World" website.

We've added elements from Flexbot to enhance and organize our html, displaying the power css brings to the table. We added some links, and some javascript.
